How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

It helped to me to see both the versions of code where it did not match.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

  It helps to revert if something goes wrong.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

  Automatic Commits will save file at regular interval so if I miss something they will be saved.
  Manual Commits helps me save the right version and not all versions.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    This allows the user to change across a bundle rather than a singular file.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    I can just use Git diff and git log to view previous versions and what was added/removed.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    It helps when you do some coding mistake you can easily revert.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

To use it in my day to day coding work.
